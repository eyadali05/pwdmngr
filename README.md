PWDMNGR

this is a CLI password generator and manager.
this program can add/edit/remove/view passwords via SQL
it is currently in CLI form and has multiple bugs but will be fixed surely.

TODO:
  . make an actual loop of the commands
  . solve the problem for removing a query
  . improve the readme.md
  . add comments
  . add a requirements.txt
  . improve the pwd_generator.py module
  
possible ideas:
  . GUI???
  . Adding machine learning implementation
  . Making it available on the cloud with additional security
  . Cross-compatiblity (mobile app with flutter frontend and python backend?)
  . improving the CLI by using c++ and actual maths instead of the random module
